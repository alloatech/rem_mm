# League Information for th0rjc

> **Note**: League participation varies year by year. This information is current as of October 2025 and reflects the 2024 NFL season. The number of leagues, team counts, and league configurations may change in future seasons based on actual Sleeper participation.

## Current Leagues (2024 Season)

### Thor's Fantasy League (TFL)
- **League ID**: `1086432375392956416`
- **Total Teams**: 12
- **Season**: 2024
- **User**: th0rjc (872612101674491904)

## Bootstrap Expectations

When you run `./scripts/complete_bootstrap.sh`:

1. **Leagues Synced**: 1 league
2. **Rosters Synced**: 12 rosters (all teams in TFL)
   - Your roster: Linked immediately
   - Other 11 rosters: Stored with `app_user_id=NULL` (linked when they register)
3. **Unique Players**: ~100-150 (12 teams Ã— 8-12 rostered players each, with overlap)
4. **Embedding Cost**: $0.010-0.015
5. **Time**: 2-3 minutes

## Roster Count Calculation

```
12 teams Ã— ~15 roster spots each = ~180 total roster slots
BUT: Many players are rostered by multiple teams
Actual unique players: ~100-150

Examples of overlap:
- Patrick Mahomes (likely on multiple teams)
- Christian McCaffrey (likely on multiple teams)
- Travis Kelce (likely on multiple teams)
```

## Cost Comparison

| Approach | Players | Cost |
|----------|---------|------|
| All players | 2,964 | $0.296 |
| Fantasy-relevant | 500 | $0.050 |
| **Your league only** | **~120** | **$0.012** âœ… |

**Savings**: 96% ($0.284 saved)

## Historical Leagues

You also have leagues in 2023 and 2022 (1 league each year). The bootstrap script uses the current year (2024) by default.

To sync past seasons, you'd need to modify the script or run manual API calls.

## Year-to-Year Variations

League participation can change each season:
- Some years you might join multiple leagues (work league, friends league, dynasty league)
- Some years you might only participate in one league
- Team counts can vary (8-team, 10-team, 12-team, 14-team leagues)
- Roster sizes and settings change per league

**The bootstrap script automatically adapts** to whatever your current season looks like by:
1. Querying Sleeper API for your active leagues
2. Syncing ALL rosters regardless of count
3. Identifying the actual unique players across your specific leagues
4. Only embedding those rostered players

This means your costs will vary based on:
- Number of leagues you're in (more leagues = more rosters = more unique players)
- League size (12-team vs 8-team)
- Roster depth (15 spots vs 20 spots)

**Typical ranges**:
- 1 league (12 teams): ~100-150 players ($0.010-0.015)
- 2 leagues (12 teams each): ~180-250 players ($0.018-0.025)
- 3 leagues (mixed sizes): ~250-350 players ($0.025-0.035)

Still 90-95% cheaper than embedding all 2,964 players! ðŸŽ¯
