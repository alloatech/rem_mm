// Smart Fantasy RAG Strategy - Real-time Filters + Stable Embeddings
// This approach minimizes costly embeddings while maximizing data freshness

export interface FantasyQueryStrategy {
  // 1. STABLE EMBEDDINGS (generated once/season)
  playerIdentityEmbeddings: {
    content: "Player: Caleb Williams, Position: QB, Team: CHI, College: USC, Experience: Rookie"
    updateFrequency: "once_per_season" // Only when player fundamentals change
    cost: "$0.0001 per player" // One-time cost
  }

  // 2. REAL-TIME FILTERS (fetched fresh every query)  
  liveDataFilters: {
    injury_status: "Questionable" // Updated multiple times per week
    practice_participation: "Limited" // Updated daily during season
    depth_chart_order: 1 // Updated when starters change
    opponent_matchup: "vs DET" // Updated weekly
    weather_conditions: "Dome" // Updated for each game
    updateFrequency: "real_time" // Every API call
    cost: "$0" // Just database queries
  }

  // 3. QUERY FLOW
  queryProcess: {
    step1: "Find relevant players using stable embeddings (semantic search)"
    step2: "Apply real-time filters (injury, matchup, weather, etc.)"
    step3: "Rank by user's roster + current conditions"
    step4: "Generate advice with fresh context"
  }
}

// EXAMPLE: "Should I start Caleb Williams this week?"
const smartQuery = {
  // Step 1: Embedding search finds "Caleb Williams" semantically
  embeddingMatch: "Player: Caleb Williams, Position: QB, Team: CHI...",
  
  // Step 2: Apply fresh filters from database
  realTimeContext: {
    injury_status: "Healthy",
    opponent: "vs DET (allows 25 fantasy points to QBs)",
    weather: "Dome game",
    depth_chart: "Starter (#1 QB)",
    user_roster: "User owns this player"
  },
  
  // Step 3: Final advice with current context
  advice: "Start Caleb Williams - healthy starter in dome game vs weak defense"
}

// COST COMPARISON:
const costAnalysis = {
  oldApproach: {
    frequency: "Daily embeddings for injury/matchup changes",
    cost: "770 players × $0.0001 × 120 days = $9.24/season",
    problems: "Expensive, overkill for temporary data"
  },
  
  smartApproach: {
    frequency: "Season embeddings + real-time filters",
    cost: "770 players × $0.0001 × 1 time = $0.08/season",
    benefits: "120x cheaper, more accurate, real-time data"
  }
