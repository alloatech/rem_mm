# Complete Bootstrap Implementation ✅

## What Was Built

### 1. Multi-User Roster System
**Database Migration**: `20251019085000_update_rosters_for_multi_user.sql`
- ✅ Added `sleeper_owner_id` to track roster ownership
- ✅ Made `app_user_id` nullable (for unregistered users)
- ✅ Updated UNIQUE constraint to `(league_id, sleeper_owner_id)`
- ✅ Created `link_user_rosters()` function for automatic linking

### 2. Enhanced User-Sync Edge Function
**File**: `supabase/functions/user-sync/index.ts`

**New/Updated Actions**:
- `register_user` - Now auto-links existing rosters via `link_user_rosters()`
- `sync_leagues` - Fetches all user's Sleeper leagues
- `sync_rosters` - **Now syncs ALL rosters in each league** (multi-user)
- `full_sync` - Complete workflow (register → leagues → rosters)
- `get_rostered_players` - **NEW**: Returns unique player IDs across all rosters

### 3. Targeted Embedding Support
**File**: `supabase/functions/simple-ingestion/index.ts`

**New Feature**: `player_ids` parameter
```json
{
  "gemini_api_key": "...",
  "player_ids": ["4866", "2133", "7564", ...]  // Specific players only
}
```

This enables embedding **only rostered players** instead of all 2,964 players.

### 4. Complete Bootstrap Script
**File**: `scripts/complete_bootstrap.sh`

**Complete Workflow**:
1. 🔐 Authenticate admin user
2. 📥 Fetch all player data from Sleeper (2,964 players)
3. 🏈 Sync admin's leagues
4. 🏆 Sync ALL rosters in those leagues (multi-user)
5. 📊 Identify unique rostered players (~150)
6. 🧠 Create embeddings ONLY for rostered players

## How It Works

### Multi-User Roster Flow

```
Admin Bootstraps System:
├── Syncs their 2 leagues
├── Fetches ALL rosters (12 teams each = 24 rosters)
├── Stores rosters with sleeper_owner_id
│   ├── Admin roster: app_user_id=<admin>, sleeper_owner_id="872612..."
│   ├── Friend 1:     app_user_id=NULL,    sleeper_owner_id="123456..."
│   ├── Friend 2:     app_user_id=NULL,    sleeper_owner_id="789012..."
│   └── ... (21 more rosters)
└── Identifies ~150 unique players across all rosters

Targeted Embedding:
├── Only embed those 150 players ($0.015)
└── 97% cost savings vs all 2,964 players ($0.50)

Friend Registers Later:
├── Signs up with email/password
├── Links Sleeper account "123456..."
├── link_user_rosters() auto-links their roster
└── They see their roster immediately!
```

### Cost Comparison

| Approach | Players Embedded | Cost | Notes |
|----------|------------------|------|-------|
| **Broad** | 2,964 (all players) | $0.30 | Old approach |
| **Filtered** | 500 (fantasy-relevant) | $0.05 | Better, but still wasteful |
| **Targeted** | ~150 (rostered only) | $0.015 | **97% savings!** ✅ |

## Usage

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# One command does everything:
./scripts/complete_bootstrap.sh
```

This will:
1. Authenticate
2. Fetch player data
3. Sync leagues
4. Sync ALL rosters
5. Identify rostered players
6. Ask if you want to create embeddings

### Manual Workflow
```bash
# 1. Register admin user
curl -X POST "http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/user-sync" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" \
  -d '{"action":"register_user","sleeper_user_id":"872612101674491904"}'

# 2. Sync leagues
curl -X POST "http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/user-sync" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" \
  -d '{"action":"sync_leagues","sleeper_user_id":"872612101674491904"}'

# 3. Sync ALL rosters
curl -X POST "http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/user-sync" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" \
  -d '{"action":"sync_rosters","sleeper_user_id":"872612101674491904"}'

# 4. Get rostered player IDs
curl -X POST "http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/user-sync" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" \
  -d '{"action":"get_rostered_players","sleeper_user_id":"872612101674491904"}'

# 5. Create embeddings (targeted)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/simple-ingestion" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" \
  -d '{
    "gemini_api_key":"...",
    "player_ids":["4866","2133","7564"]
  }'
```

## Testing

### 1. Test Multi-User Roster Sync
```bash
# Run league sync (should store all rosters)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/user-sync" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" \
  -d '{"action":"sync_rosters","sleeper_user_id":"872612101674491904"}'

# Check database
psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres \
  -c "SELECT sleeper_owner_id, app_user_id, league_id FROM user_rosters;"

# Should see rosters with NULL app_user_id (unregistered users)
```

### 2. Test Automatic Linking
```bash
# Register a new user
curl -X POST "http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/user-sync" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEW_USER_JWT" \
  -d '{"action":"register_user","sleeper_user_id":"123456789"}'

# Check if their roster was linked
psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres \
  -c "SELECT * FROM user_rosters WHERE sleeper_owner_id='123456789';"

# Should now show app_user_id populated
```

### 3. Test Targeted Embedding
```bash
# Get rostered players
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/user-sync" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" \
  -d '{"action":"get_rostered_players","sleeper_user_id":"872612101674491904"}')

PLAYER_IDS=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -c '.player_ids')
PLAYER_COUNT=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -r '.player_count')

echo "Found $PLAYER_COUNT rostered players"
echo "Cost: \$$(echo "scale=4; $PLAYER_COUNT * 0.0001" | bc)"
```
